<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
I am a principal researcher in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-innovation">System Innovation</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/privacy-preserving-machine-learning-innovation/">Privacy Preserving Machine Learning Innovation</a> groups at Microsoft. Before joining Microsoft, I am a researcher in NEC Laboratories America. I received the Ph.D. in Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech, in 2019. My advisor is Prof. <a href="http://www.nvc.cs.vt.edu/~ctlu/">Chang-Tien Lu</a>. Before starting my Ph.D. degree, I had some industry working experience in Microsoft, SAP, etc. I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> in 2009. In the broad area of data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing, my research interests include: 1) Robust model learning in massive data sets under adversarial data corruption. 2) Text mining tasks such as uncertainty models in document classification, dynamic topic modeling, and user comments mining. 3) Interdisciplinary applications in areas such as multi-factor personality prediction, spatiotemporal event forecasting in hyper-local price data.

<!--My research interests include self-paced robust learning, scalable robust regression model, spatiotemporal event forecasting.-->
